        Wavelink is a word association game. In each round, you and your partner receive 2 starting words.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        You respond by submitting a word that connects those words. For example:
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        If the starting words are <b>Fire</b> and <b>Water</b>, you might submit <b>Element</b>.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        If you and your partner submit the same word, you win the round!
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Otherwise, you try again. Now, you&apos;ll both be trying to connect the two words you just submitted.
        For example, if you submitted <b>Element</b> but your partner submitted <b>Steam</b>, you might submit <b>Gas</b>.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        You get up to 5 tries to connect per round!
      </div>
